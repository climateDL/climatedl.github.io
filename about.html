Probability theory, stochastic processes, and risk analysis are also related areas for the research program. As applications, extreme climate events have a large impact on agriculture, human health, water resources, and network infrastructures (e.g. telecommunication and energy distribution, another field where the participants have a long experience), among many others.</p><h2 dir="auto" data-sourcepos="15:1-15:11"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#abstract" class="anchor" id="user-content-abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="16:1-20:397">Forecasting extreme seasonal temperature events is especially relevant to society and its ecosystem due to their potentially dangerous impacts. Despite the above, the study of this problem is still very incipient in South America, where most of the methods proposed in the literature correspond to process-based dynamic models and classical statistical methods. Increasing the accuracy of predicting the probability of occurrence of extreme temperatures at the seasonal scale would have huge impacts on our economical life (on our food production, on our energy consumption), on our health, etc. Currently, innovative approaches are emerging in climate forecasting, using network science and machine learning methodologies. The complex interrelations between temporal and spatial variables in climate time-series justify the use of climate networks as an underlying automatic model explanation of the complex physical processes involved. The use of machine learning methods, and in particular deep learning architectures, is justified by their success in several forecasting problems. In this project, we will evaluate the precision of the most prominent deep-learning architectures for our forecasting problem, and in particular, those implementing spatio-temporal models based on graphs (climate networks). The most promising antecedents for the use of this methodology are several works based on climate networks and on the effect of “El Niño” on similar forecasting problems. We expect to propose improvements to these deep learning architectures to increase their precision in our particular problems. For example, changing the scale of nodes, changing the similarity of edges, proposing new architectures that include multiple networks, training the model with augmented data, etc. We will implement and compare the results with classical statistical methods, such as the principal component regression technique and Wavelet transform-based methods, among others. Assuming we achieve good predictive quality, we will evaluate the impact of these predictions on some human activities, and we will focus on risk analysis of specific infrastructures (telecommunication networks, energy distribution) and on some other concrete case studies in situations where the considered extreme events have a strong negative impact and for which historical data are available.</p><p dir="auto" data-sourcepos="24:1-26:49"> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__share"></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"></footer></article><nav class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav__prev"><a href="https://climatedl.github.io/workshop.html" rel="prev" class="post-nav__link">Previous Post<h5>Workshop</h5></a></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://climatedl.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://climatedl.github.io/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=5977caa3bd6c30eab5c559ded3288d58"></script></body></html>
